## Part 11: Implementing your TableViewDataSource

In Parts 9 and 10, you did the leg work on adding a UITableView to your Storyboard. If we try it in the simulator, though, it doesn't actually do anything yet. (You may or may not see the lines, depending on the scaled resolution of your simulator.)

We need to add the code that controls the Table View itself. `UITableView` has two delegate-type classes: `UITableViewDelegate` and `UITableViewDataSource`. The *Delegate* controls aspects like row height and user interaction, while the *Data Source* actually provides the Table View with data. We only need to implement the **Data Source**.

### Turning our View Controller into a Data Source

`UITableViewDataSource` is a protocol that can be conformed to by any class. Because of the way our project is set up so far, it makes perfect sense to make our `ViewController` class simply conform to the protocol instead of creating an entire new class.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource {
```

Now you'll get some errors if you try and build your project. And that's totally expected. `UITableViewDataSource` requires that we implement two specific functions before the class can be considered to conform to the protocol: `tableView(_:numberOfRowsInSection:)` and `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)`. 

`numberOfRowsInSection` tells the data source how many rows the table should have, and `cellForRowAt` creates a copy of the prototype cell that we made in Part 10.

#### numberOfRowsInSection:

We need to figure out how many rows are in our table. Speaking of, how are we actually deciding what goes in the table??

This is taken care of by the default CalculationDelegate that you've been using the whole time. The class has a `previousExpressions` array that holds the previous expressions entered by the user (as the name sorta implies). All we need to do is return the number of items in that array.

```swift
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
    return calculations.previousExpressions.count
}
```

#### cellForRowAt:

This one is a bit more complicated. First I'll show you the implementation so you can suck it all in, and then I'll explain.

```swift
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let index = indexPath.item
    let (expression, result) = calculations.previousExpressions[index]

    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "paperTapeCell") as! PaperTapeCell
    cell.customize(expression + " " + result)
    return cell
}
```

##### Line by line explanation, for the sake of knowledge

```swift
let index = indexPath.item
```
In UIKit, an `IndexPath` is a representation of both a *Section* and an *Item* within that section. In our table view, we're only using one section, so `indexPath.section` will always be zero. We want the number of the item within that section, so we use `indexPath.item`.

```swift
let (expression, result) = calculations.previousExpressions[index]
```

`calculations.previousExpression` is an array of the type `[(String, String)]`. The parenthesis are part of what's called a **Tuple**, allowing us to store multiple values in the same object. Each item of the array has the type `(String, String)`. We pull out a value from the array (`index`) and then save the two values to `expression` and `result`.

```swift
let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "paperTapeCell") as! PaperTapeCell
```

This is the part that actually creates out `UITableViewCell`. There are three major things happening here:
1. We dequeue a cell with the identifier that we set in Interface Builder. If you followed what I did, that identifier is `paperTapeCell`.
2. The `dequeueReusableCell` function returns a `UITableViewCell`. 
3. We know that this cell is a `PaperTapeCell`, because we set the custom class of our prototype cell. We use `as!` to force-cast the cell to the correct class. It's ok for us to do the forcibly (with an `!`), because we know it will never fail.

```swift
cell.customize(expression + " " + result)
```

Remember when we wrote the `customize` function inside of `PaperTapeCell` in Part 10? We did that so we could use it here. We call it here and let the cell itself handle the customization.

```swift
return cell
```

The culmination of all this work, we return our `PaperTapeCell`. From there, UIKit does its magic and throws it up on screen.

### Connecting the Table View to the Data Source

As of now, our `ViewController` is a valid `UITableViewDataSource`, but we still haven't told our Table View to use the View Controller *as its data source*. To do this, we need to make another connection in our Storyboard. Open up `Main.storyboard` again.

You'll want to **control-drag** from the Table View to the View Controller. It's probably easiest to do that in the View Hierarchy on the left.

Then select dataSource, and you should be all set.

### Testing in the Simulator

Fire up the simulator and see what happens. Type some expressions and see what the Table View does.

**Drumroll...........** nothing. The Table View never updates.

#### What's happening here?

We have the functions in place to configure the Table View, but these functions don't just get called at random. We have to tell our Table View to reload its data. Specifically, we need to call `tableView.reloadData()`.

### Recap
We implemented `UITableViewDataSource` as a part of our `ViewController` and connected it to our Table View, but nothing happens on screen yet.

### Next Time
We'll make the table view reload when it needs to, and add in an animation.
